# Resource Allocation 

### Design
- 0-1 Knapsack algo has been used, which minimises the cost and maximises the resources. 
- There are two files:
	- `res-alloc.py` has methods to create a 2-D Matrix and calculate cost and instances used 
	- `configs.py` hours, cost, instances, cpus and min capacity can be asisgned in this file 

### Execution
- run python res-alloc.py
